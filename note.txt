===========
Router - navigate to different pages, client side, never refresh page
angular-route.min.js
angular-route.min.js.map
Central controller knows what event to what page, instead of the page itself to know where the page is. (Design Pattern)
Use the url to remember the state. Back and Forward button still work.
