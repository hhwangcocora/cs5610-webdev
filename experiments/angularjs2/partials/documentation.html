<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>In this experiment, I practised using Angular JS Routing mechanism to navigate between pages without reloading them.</p>
<p>It configures <code>$routeProvider</code> to route for different pages in a a centralized place, then use <code>ng-view</code>
to embed the page which is navigated to. Since the page is not reloaded entirely, the state of the which page is currently loaded is stored in url. Thus user can
    click back and forth history buttons. </p>
<p>Also I put a path-like navigation when it is on sub pages. For example <code>Home/Documentation</code>. This allows
user to understand the website hierarchy.</p>
