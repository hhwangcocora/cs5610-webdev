<h3>
    First Blog in Web Development</h3>
<h4>
    HomePage
</h4>
<p>
    In this week, I created the homepage of my website
</p>
<p>
    The homepage currently just contain my picture and brief introduction. I also added a
    link to experiments.
</p>
<p>
    Next step, I'll stylish my homepage using css, and maybe using more advanced technology
    to make it more vivid.

<h4>
    Experiments
</h4>
<p>
    The experiment contains 5 exercises focusing on html and css. I practised basic elements
    of html and css and also used them to form a border layout and responsive design.
</p>
<p>
    Next step, I will learn about bootstrap and jQuery, to make the page more interactive.
