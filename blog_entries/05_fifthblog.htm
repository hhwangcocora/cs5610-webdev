<h3>
    Week 5 in Web Development</h3>
<h4>
    Experiments
</h4>
<p>
    In this week, I continued to do experiments about Angular JS. This week the experiments are more
    advanced, where the technologies like routing and service are involved. Besides that, I also tried
    showing google map and charts on html page per personal interest. Those are implemented by calling
    corresponding libraries, and can greatly enrich my web pages. Finally, I implemented a task timer
    where user can record the time spent on each task.
