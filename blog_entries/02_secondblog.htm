<h4>
    Experiments
</h4>
<p>
    In this week, I performed 5 experiments about bootstrap css and javascript. It was really fun to
    accomplish useful features using simple code. Bootstrap provides really nice building blocks, and
    helps me to focus on the main logic.
</p>
<p>
    I intend to make the experiments useful in my future projects, so I choose following features:
    <ul>
    <li>Search page with filters <a href="../experiments/bootstrap/1_searchbar.html" target="_blank" >Go to the experiment</a></li>
    <li>Slide show of pictures <a href="../experiments/bootstrap/2_slideshow.html" target="_blank" >Go to the experiment</a></li>
    <li>Expandable comments <a href="../experiments/bootstrap/3_expandable_comments.html" target="_blank" >Go to the experiment</a></li>
    <li>Tables with popover to show description <a href="../experiments/bootstrap/4_tables.html" target="_blank" >Go to the experiment</a></li>
    <li>A change password popup dialog <a href="../experiments/bootstrap/5_popups.html" target="_blank" >Go to the experiment</a></li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    Next step, I will learn about jQuery and Javascript.
